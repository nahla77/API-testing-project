#  API Testing Project – Reqres.in

This project is a practical implementation of **API testing** using [Reqres.in](https://reqres.in), a fake REST API for testing and prototyping.  
The goal is to test various endpoints for correctness, structure, error handling, and dynamic data validation using Postman.

---

##  Project Overview

- Built and organized Postman Collections to test user-related API endpoints.
- Created and configured Environment Variables for reusable and dynamic data.
- Wrote JavaScript Test Scripts to validate responses, check structure, and verify logic.
- Executed tests using Postman Collection Runner.
- Prepared a professional documentation and presentation to explain test scenarios and results.
